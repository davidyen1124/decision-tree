THE "I MADE THIS WHILE PROCRASTINATING" LICENSE
Version 1.0, Because Version Numbers Make Things Look Official

Copyright (c) [Year] [Your Name Here] - Or whoever wants to claim credit, I'm too busy connecting boxes with lines.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND DEFINITELY NOT TAKING SERIOUSLY:

0. Preamble (because fancy licenses have these)
   This LICENSE exists primarily to make me feel like a real developer.
   No lawyers were consulted in the making of this document.
   Proceed at your own risk of eye-rolling.

1. You are hereby granted permission to use this software
   IF AND ONLY IF you promise to never admit how much time you wasted 
   making chatbots that could be replaced by three buttons labeled "Yes," "No," 
   and "Let me speak to a human."

2. You may modify this code, though we question why you'd bother.
   If you do "improve" it, please acknowledge that you are the kind of person
   who enjoys rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

3. Redistribution is allowed provided you don't claim it's revolutionary AI technology.
   It's boxes. Connected by lines. Let's not get carried away.

4. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", because honestly, what did you expect?
   In no event shall the authors be held responsible for:
   - Your unrealistic expectations
   - Existential crises triggered by building decision trees
   - The realization that your "AI solution" is just a glorified flowchart
   - Any other disappointments, large or small, that life may bring

5. If this project is featured in a job interview or portfolio, you must
   recite three times: "This is not the height of my technical achievements."

6. Warranty: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Good one.

DISCLAIMER OF SERIOUSNESS:
This license is about as legally binding as a pinky promise.
If you need a real license, please consult actual open-source licenses like MIT, 
Apache, or GPL, and not whatever this is.
